## Day 6

Got a new Router from Verizon and had to reset all my settings. I sort of figured I might try some other stuff this time around before getting it online. I've heard a lot of good stuff about Tailscale. So I'm going to try to install that.

I'm going to start with [this walkthrough from Pi My Life Up](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-tailscale/).

Gonna do my upgrades!

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
