## How do you solve a problem of unseen-code?

I've [been thinking a lot about how to get better at code when it's in my own side projects](https://twitter.com/Chronotope/status/1390700217838841860). I do these side projects pretty much in isolation. Maybe sometimes I get a comment or, if I tweet about it enough and it's relevant, it might get rolled into some blog post. When that happens it's great! But it doesn't really give me feedback on my work or the quality of it. Without feedback it's hard to improve.

Now, don't get me wrong, I do these projects for myself. I do them because I want to find something out and I need a tool to do it. I do them to learn new things because learning is fun. I do them because I want to create something cool that lets me play in code. These are all core to why I even bother with side projects.

I have a good employer who lets me build in time to do research when I need to learn something professionally and so while learning is an important aspect of working on my code side projects it isn't the core target outcome. But **still**, I don't want to stagnate in these side projects. I want them to get better, I want them to make me better, I want to make *the projects* better, and I want to advance my skills while working them.

At work, when I am putting code together, I get opportunities to talk over ideas, plan architecture, and then of course I get feedback on my approach and technique in pull requests. Sometimes, as we all know, PRs can be frustrating, because I thought I was done or I can disagree with the specifics of an approach, but I always learn something, even if it is just another way to approach how to write code.

This process makes better coders. It makes me a better coder. Exponentially so. I badly miss it when it comes to side projects, but there doesn't really seem to be any formal structures around how to make getting feedback part of the casual coding projects. So I thought about this for a while.

Then three things happened.

### Play To Find Out

One: I started to play more Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA) Tabletop games. Then I started to write Powered by the Apocalypse games. Then I started to write rulesets for Powered by the Apocalypse games. Which meant reading a lot of other people's PbtA games. I saw and came to appreciate one of the core rules for all Powered by the Apocalypse games is "[Play to Find Out](https://twitter.com/lumpleygames/status/1152247889885876224)".

Play to find Out is deceptively simple, it means that you don't predecide the outcomes. It means that games don't go off the rails because they don't have the rails. You have a general endpoint in mind... maybe... but the more important thing is to not be a game "master" in the way D&D games are run, but to be a facilitator. It's to let go of the style of absolute control and realize that sometimes decisions come from outside and are driven by accident and play as much as they are by starting intention.

This was the first idea to build on because it meant that I started thinking about these side projects less as projects that leveraged things I knew and more as opportunities to explore the ecosystems and communities of the projects I built on top of, and potentially contribute back to them. I wasn't just going to go with my favorite tool, or what I wanted to learn, I was also going to go with the flow to some extent, [even if it meant trying a library I neither needed to learn or would get any particular job-relevant knowledge from](https://fightwithtools.dev/posts/projects/devblog/retro-markdown-it/).

Two: I started to get into math

I was also super jealous of https://twitter.com/pfrazee/status/1371174362531962880 and his [dev-vlog](https://ctzn.network/dev-vlog)
