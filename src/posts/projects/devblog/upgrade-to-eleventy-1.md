## Project Scope and ToDos

1. Static Site Generator that can build the blog and let me host it on Github Pages
2. I want to write posts in Markdown because I'm lazy, it's easy, and it is how I take notes now.
3. I don't want to spend a ton of time doing design work. I'm doing complicated designs for other projects, so I want to pull a theme I like that I can rely on someone else to keep up.
4. Once it gets going, I want template changes to be easy.
5. It should be as easy as Jekyll, so I need to be able to build it using GitHub Actions, where I can just commit a template change or Markdown file and away it goes. If I can't figure this out than fk it, just use Jekyll.
6. I require it to be used by a significant percent of my professional peers so I can get easy answers when something goes wrong.
7. I want source maps. This is a dev log site which means whatever I do with it should be easy for other developers to read.

- [x] Also [the sitemap plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quasibit/eleventy-plugin-sitemap) looks cool. Should grab that later.

<s>

- [ ] So does the [reading time one](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-reading-time).

</s>

- [x] Also [this TOC plugin](https://github.com/jdsteinbach/eleventy-plugin-toc/) mby?

- [x] Use [Data Deep Merge](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-deep-merge/) in this blog.

- [x] Decide if I want to render the CSS fancier than just a base file and do per-template splitting.

<s>

- [ ] Can I use the template inside of dinky that already exists instead of copy/pasting it?

</s>

<s>

- [ ] Is there a way to have permalinks to posts contain metadata without organizing them into subfolders?

</s>

- [x] How do I cachebreak files on the basis of new build events? Datetime? `site.github.build_revision` is [how Jekyll accomplishes this](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/blob/master/docs/site.github.md), but is there a way to push [that](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#github-context) [into the build process](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54310050/how-to-version-build-artifacts-using-github-actions) for 11ty?

- [x] Make link text look less shitty. It looks like it is a whole, lighter, font.

- [x] Code blocks do not have good syntax highlighting. I want good syntax highlighting.

- [x] Build a Markdown-it plugin to take my typing shortcuts `[prob, b/c, ...?]` and expand them on build.

<s>

- [ ] See if we can start Markdown's interpretation of H tags to [start at 2, since H1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#multiple_h1) is always pulled from the page title metadata. If it isn't easy, I just have to change my pattern of writing in the MD documents.

</s>

- [x] Should I [explore some shortcodes](https://www.madebymike.com.au/writing/11ty-filters-data-shortcodes/)?

- [x] Order projects listing by last posted blog in that project

- [x] Limit the output of home page post lists to a specific number of posts

- [x] Show the latest post below the site intro on the homepage.

- [x] Tags pages with Pagination

- [x] Posts should be able to support a preview header image that can also be shown on post lists.

- [x] Create a Markdown-It plugin that reads the project's repo URL off the folder data file and renders commit messages with [links to the referenced commit](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15919635/on-github-api-what-is-the-best-way-to-get-the-last-commit-message-associated-w). (Is this even possible?) (Is there a way to do it with eleventy instead?)

- [x] Create Next Day/Previous Day links on each post / Next/Previous post on post templates from projects

- [x] Tags should be in the sidebar of articles and link to tag pages

- [x] Create a skiplink for the todo section (or would this be better served with the ToC plugin?) - Yes it would be!

- [x] Add a Things I Learned section to the project pages that are the things I learned from that specific project.

- [x] Add a technical reading log to the homepage

- [x] [Hide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:empty) empty sections.

- [x] Add byline to post pages

- [x] Have table of contents attach to sidebar bottom on mobile

- [x] Support dark mode

- [x] Social Icons

- [x] SEO/Social/JSON-LD HEAD data

- [ ] Create a per-project `/now` page.
- [ ] Create a whole-site aggregated `/now` page.

## Day 43

Ok, so I want to update Eleventy to v1. In part, because I want to try some features. So let's give it a go!

I installed [11ty's upgrade helper](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-upgrade-help), and it passes me. It helps that apparently most of the changes were to Liquid stuff which I don't use.

Ok, things look good. I'll have to check what, if anything, changes. I got a warning about my sitemap plugin from NPM, but `http://localhost:8080/sitemap.xml` on my local build looks fine. So... looking good?
