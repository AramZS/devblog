Hello World!

This is [my](http://aramzs.github.io/) outpost for documenting and live blogging my work on various side projects. Occasionally it is also the place I write about stuff I learned or useful information. Sometimes it can also be a place for rough writing that is dev-adjacent but doesn't really make sense for [my main blog](https://aramzs.github.io/).
